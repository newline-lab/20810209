Overview

In this lab, we are going to create a ROS workspace and a ROS package, launch a Turtlebot robot and play with it, launch a robot arm and play with it.

While following the step-by-step tutorials, please take your time to think about what you are doing and what happens in each step, with the help of Google if necessary.

Preview: Next week we are going to learn how to write Python scripts to control the Turtlebot robot.
